# Diabetes Prediction with Artificial Neural Networks

This repository contains a **group project** focused on predicting the likelihood of diabetes using artificial neural networks (ANN). The work includes dataset preprocessing, model construction, training, and evaluation of various ANN configurations.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The report included in this repository is written in **Polish**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop and analyze artificial neural network models capable of predicting the risk of diabetes based on patient data such as:
- Number of pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age

The dataset used for training and evaluation was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), based on the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset.

## Report Contents

The report includes:
- Data preprocessing steps
- Literature review comparing ANN models for diabetes prediction
- Evaluation of different ANN configurations (layers, neurons, optimizers, activation functions, test sample sizes)
- Results analysis using Accuracy, Loss, MSE, MAE
- Summary of overfitting risks and parameter impact
